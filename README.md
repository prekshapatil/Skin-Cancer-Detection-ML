# Skin-Cancer-Detection-ML
A Machine Learning-based skin cancer detection system using CNNs to analyze dermoscopic images. Users can upload images via a React.js web app, where the model classifies them for potential skin cancer detection. Built with Python, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning, this project aims to enhance early diagnosis and accessibility.
